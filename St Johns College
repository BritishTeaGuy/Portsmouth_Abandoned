About the Building

St John’s College, Southsea, is a prominent example of Edwardian architecture. The building is notable for its neo-Gothic style, which features high, pointed arches and decorative stonework. It consists of multiple floors, with different sections housing various educational facilities, including classrooms, dormitories, and communal spaces. The college's central building, which was known as the "Castle" by students, includes large, ornate windows that provide ample natural light. Other key architectural highlights include its turret-like towers, steep gables, and a large clock tower, adding a medieval character to the structure. The college's layout included various wings that housed different departments and facilities, such as the chapel, sports hall, and music rooms.

Current State: Despite being abandoned, much of the building remains structurally intact. The firme, which housed the sports facilities, including the sports hall, dance studio, and auditorium, is in pristine condition, untouched by time. However, demolition work has recently begun at the rear of the building. So far, the sports hall and dance studios have been demolished, and it's uncertain how much longer the remaining sections will stand.
